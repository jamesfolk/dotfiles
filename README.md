CLONING OUR DOTFILES TO ANOTHER MACHINE

`git clone https://github.com/jamesfolk/dotfiles.git`

Once the repository has been cloned to our home directory, simply change the `dotfiles` directory, make the `makesymlinks.sh` script executable, and run the script like so:

	cd ~/dotfiles
	chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
	./makesymlinks.sh
